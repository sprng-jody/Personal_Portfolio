            <h2>Consistent Top & Honor Student</h2>
            <p>Starting from my Grade 10 journey, I consistently ranked among the top students in my class, alternating between Top 1 and Top 2. My dedication, discipline, and commitment to excellence naturally earned me the distinction of being an Honors student. During my junior high school years at Victorino Mapa High School, I established a strong academic foundation that allowed me to continuously excel across different subjects. 
                Later, as I pursued my senior high school education at Golden Success College - Manila, 
                I continued this trajectory of achievement, further honing my skills and maintaining my standing as one of the most consistent academic performers. These experiences not only shaped my academic resilience but also instilled in me the perseverance, adaptability, and determination needed to succeed in more advanced studies and future endeavors.

            <h2>Graduated with High Honors</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Because of my consistent efforts, perseverance, and willingness to make personal sacrifices for the sake of my studies, I was able to graduate from senior high school with High Honors. 
                This recognition was not simply a reflection of academic performance, but also of the dedication and determination I poured into every subject, project, and requirement throughout my journey. 
                As a result of this commitment, I proudly ranked 10th among the entire graduating batch, an achievement that symbolizes both my resilience and my unwavering pursuit of excellence.

            <h2>Class Representative</h2>
            <br>
            <p>During my final year of senior high school, I was entrusted with the role of Class President, where I developed and demonstrated my leadership, organizational, and decision-making skills. 
                Alongside this responsibility, I actively contributed as a committee member for the intramurals teams, helping coordinate events and ensuring smooth collaboration among different groups. 
                Beyond academics and sports, I also explored my creativity by serving as a costume maker and designer for our class's pageant show, where I combined artistry and resourcefulness to bring our concepts to life. 
                These diverse experiences allowed me to balance leadership, teamwork, and creativity, shaping me into a well-rounded student leader.
